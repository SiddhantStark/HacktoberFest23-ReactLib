## Issue Tracking

## Coding Standards

1. Write clean, well-documented code following best practices and ReactJS conventions.

## Pull Requests

1. Make sure your branch is up to date with the main repository.

2. Create a pull request (PR) with a descriptive title and a reference to the issue (if applicable).

3. Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR, explaining what the code does and why you made the changes.

4. PRs should be small and focused on a single feature or bug fix. If you're working on multiple features, create a separate branch and PR for each.

5. Address any feedback or comments on your PR and be prepared to make changes if requested.

6. Once the PR is approved, it will be merged into the main repository.
